Security is the most important factor in day to-day life. The need for security is the basic necessity of every individual. The sensation that we are safe and everything around us is fine is imperative for peaceful living. Be that because it may, during this unsafe world, when crime, terror, and dangers are at their pinnacle, how might one achieve that suspicion of safety? Here, a laser security system provides us with an answer and for this reason, more and more people are installing them so as to remain order safe and secure. They once accustomed to being very expensive solutions for security needs. Owing to cost-cutting and fast technological advancements, this type of security system is becoming more pocket friendly. During this project, we've designed Laser Light Security System Using Arduino with Alarm and LED with the applying of Laser Diode Module and Laser sensor module, and for extra Security, an alert system using SIM900A to send SMS alert to the user. Many people secure their homes, office, shops, warehouses, etc with the Tripwire security system of the document, cut and paste into it, and/or use markup styles.
